This code is very useful for anyone doing any web analysis on matlab who want to scrap images off a website. The code can download all images in a webpage but what is cool ablout this project is that the user can train the AlexNet to certain class as shown in the video then the user can choose this class so the scraper only download images with items that belong to this class, so this code merges web analysis with machine learning and computer vision to give a selective images scraper.

The downloaded images is saved in a folder the user chooses along with a CSV file that has the metadata of the downloaded images as shown in video.
